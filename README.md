## Linear regression (Ridge and Lasso) and logistic regression without using machine learning libraries, comparison with sklearn models.  
#### I implemented some models without using machine learning libraries.  
#### I also did EDA, one-hot encoding, calculated many metrics without special libraries.
## Detailed comments are in code files.
